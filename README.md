Hello, welcome, and thank you for stopping by odin-recipe repo

This project is to create a website with a main index page
with links to seperate pages that will contain various
food recipes.

The skills that I will demonstrate will be the foundations 
I have learned so far such as HTMLs basic template, or 
boilerplate. The use of both relative and absolute links
I will also be using images along with lists. the lists 
will be ordered and unordered with nested lists to make 
things easier to read.
