            <h3>Quick & Easy S**t on a Shingle</h3>
            <p>     The ultimate comfort food, and a wonderful memory of my childhood. Cream chipped beef
                or SoS as you may hear it called ("S**t on a shingle") is delicious served over most 
                breakfast foods, such as eggs, potatoes, biscuts or just as enjoyable by itself. The ease 
                of the recipe, few ingredients, and leftovers are just as enjoyable, make this one of my
                favorite dishes

                
            </p>
            <p>
                    Creamed chipped beef is a white cream sauce with dried beef added in although it can be
                substituted for budding meat which is available at most grocery stores. I have also seen 
                recipes using ground or chopped beef, I have not tried this but I'm sure its delicious.
                This recipe has it served over toast, the bread used is completely your choice. We used 
                whatever was getting stale as kids but my personal favorite is a bagel. So grab a loaf
                of your favorite bread and lets get cooking.
