    </p>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Put a large pot of salted water (1 Tbsp salt for every<br>
                 2 quarts of water) on the stovetop on high heat. <br>
                 It can take a while for a large pot of water to come <br>
                 to a boil (this will be your pasta water), so prepare <br>
                 the sauce in the next steps while the  water is heating.</li><br>
            <li>In a large skillet heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium-<br>
                high heat. Add the ground beef and cook until it is lightly <br>
                browned on all sides.Remove the beef with a slotted spoon <br>
                to a bowl. Drain off all but a tablespoon of fat.</li><br>
            <li>Add the diced bell pepper and onions to skillet <br>
                Cook for 4 to 5 minutes, until the onions are translucent<br>
                and the peppers softened. Add the minced garlic and cook <br>
                half a minute more.<br>
                <br>
                Return the browned ground beef to the pan. Stir to combine,<br>
                reduce the heat to low and cook for another 5 minutes.</li><br>
            
                <li>Transfer the beef mixture to a medium sized (3- to 4-quart) pot.<br>
                Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, and tomato paste to the pot.<br>
                Add the parsley, oregano, and Italian seasonings, adjusting<br> 
                the amounts to taste. Sprinkle with garlic powder and/or garlic <br>
                salt, to taste.<br>
                <br>
                Sprinkle with red or white wine vinegar. Stir in sugar, a <br>
                tablespoon at a time, tasting after each addition, to taste.<br>
                (The amount of sugar needed will vary, depending on how acidic<br>
                the tomatoes are that you are using.)<br>
                Add salt to taste, and note that you will later be adding <br>
                Parmesan, which is salty.<br>
                <br>
                Bring the sauce to a simmer and then lower the heat to maintain<br>
                a low simmer. Cook for 15 to 45 minutes, stirring often. Scrape<br>
                the bottom of the pot every so often so nothing sticks to the<br>
                bottom and scorches.<br>
                <br>
                Remove from heat.</li><br>
            
            <li>By now the salted water you started heating in step one should <br>
                be boiling. Add the dry lasagna noodles and cook them to al <br>
                dente, per package directions. (Note noodles may be cooked in<br>
                advance.)<br>
                <br>
                Stir often to prevent from sticking. Make sure that water <br>
                remains at a full rolling boil during the entire cooking to <br>
                prevent noodles from sticking.<br>
                <br>
                When ready, drain in a colander and rinse with cool water, <br>
                gently separating any noodles that may be sticking together.<br>
                <br>
                Spread a little olive oil on a large rimmed baking sheet, <br>
                and lay out the cooked noodles on this sheet, turning them <br>
                over so that they get coated with a little of the olive oil.<br>
                This will prevent them from sticking together.

            </li><br>
            <li>Heat the oven to 375°F</li><br>
            <li>Assemble the lasagna In a 9x13-inch casserole or lasagna dish,<br>
                ladle a cup of sauce and spread it over the bottom of the dish.<br>
                Arrange one layer of lasagna noodles lengthwise (about 3 long <br>
                noodles, edge may overlap, depending on your pan) over the sauce. <br>
                Ladle a third of the remaining sauce over the noodles.<br>
                <br>
                Sprinkle a layer of a third of the grated mozzarella on top of <br>
                lasagna sauce. Add half of the ricotta cheese, by placing cheese<br>
                dollops every couple inches. Sprinkle half the grated parmesan <br>
                cheese evenly over the top of ricotta cheese.<br>
                <br>
                Apply second layer of noodles, top it with half of the remaining<br>
                sauce. Add half of the remaining Mozzarella, the remaining ricotta<br>
                cheese, and another the remaining Parmesan.<br>
                <br>
                Finish with another layer of noodles. Spread the remaining sauce <br>
                over the top layer of noodles and sprinkle with the remaining <br>
                Mozzarella cheese.<br>
                </li><br>
                <li>Bake Cover the lasagna pan with aluminum foil, tented slightly <br>
                    so it doesn't touch the noodles or sauce). Bake at 375°F for <br>
                    45 minutes. Uncover in the last 10 minutes if you'd like more <br>
                    of a crusty top or edges.</li><br>
                <li>Cool and serve, Allow the lasagna to cool at least 15 before <br>
                    serving. Leftovers will keep for about 5 days. May be reheated <br>
                    in conventional oven or microwave. Leave aluminum tent on for <br>
                    storage. <br>
                    (Try to keep the aluminum foil from touching the sauce.)</li>
