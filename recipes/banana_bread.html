         <h3>Best Banana Bread Ever</h3>
         <p>
            Put those ripe bananas to use 
            in the best banana bread recipe ever.
            Moist and delicious, it's easy to make—one bowl,
            no need for a mixer!
        </p>
            <p>
                 This banana bread has been the most popular
                 recipe on Simply Recipes for over 10 years.
                 For good reason A mixing bowl,<br> a fork to whisk the eggs,
                 and a sturdy spoon to mix the batter are all you need. 
                 The sugar amount is flexible. <br>The original recipe 
                 called for a cup of white sugar, but most people
                 do just fine with 3/4 cup, 
                 and many are happy with 1/2 cup.

                You can toss in a cup of chopped nuts, 
                raisins, or chocolate chips if you want, 
                or put the batter into muffin tins and make 
                banana nut muffins instead.

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li> 2 to 3 medium (7" to 7-7/8" long) very ripe bananas, 
                    peeled (about 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 cups mashed)
                </li>
                <li>1/3 cup (76g) butter, unsalted or salted, melted</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda (not baking powder)</li>
                <li>1 pinch salt</li>
                <li>3/4 cup (150g) sugar (1/2 cup if you would like it 
                    less sweet, 1 cup if more sweet)</li>
                <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                <li>1 1/2 cups (205g) all-purpose flour</li>
            </ul>

            
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C), 
                    and butter an 8 x 4-inch loaf pan.</li>
                <li>In a mixing bowl, mash the ripe bananas 
                    with a fork until completely smooth. 
                    Stir the melted butter into the
                     mashed bananas.</li>
                <li>Mix in the baking soda and salt. Stir 
                    in the sugar, beaten egg, and vanilla extract.
                     Mix in the flour</li>
                <li>Pour the batter into your prepared loaf pan.</li>
                <li>Bake for 55 to 65 minutes at 350°F (175°C), 
                    or until a toothpick or wooden skewer inserted 
                    into the center comes out clean.<br> A few dry crumbs 
                    are okay; streaks of wet batter are not. 
                    If the outside of the loaf is browned but the
                    center is still wet, <br>loosely tent the loaf with 
                    foil and continue baking until the loaf is fully baked.</li>
                <li>Remove from oven and let cool in the pan for a few minutes. 
                    Then remove the banana bread from the pan and let cool <br>
                    completely before serving. Slice and serve. 
                    (A bread knife helps to make slices that aren't crumbly.)

                    Wrapped well, <br> the banana bread will keep at room 
                    temperature for 4 days. For longer storage, 
                    refrigerate the loaf up to 5 days, or freeze it.</li>
